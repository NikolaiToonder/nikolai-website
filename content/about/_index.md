## Hi, I’m Nikolai

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013-->
I’m a computer engineering student who loves diving into how things work - from the software I write to the hardware it runs on.
I spend a lot of time experimenting with Linux, exploring different development tools, and building small projects to learn something new every time.

What really drives me is the process of problem-solving and improving how systems run. Whether it’s writing clean, efficient code or setting up a smoother workflow, I enjoy finding better ways to make technology work for people.

Outside of coding, I usually play games, read about new tech trends, or learn something that helps me grow as a developer.

If you’d like to see what I’ve been working on, take a look at the software tab!
