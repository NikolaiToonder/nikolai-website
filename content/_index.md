Welcome!  
I’m Nikolai — a software engineer with a strong interest in software security. I’m currently studying at NTNU, and this website serves both as my personal portfolio and a small experimental playground.  

I built it to showcase my work, explore new technologies, and gain hands-on experience with modern web development and security concepts.  

Use the sidebar to browse around — you’ll find my projects, art, and other things I’ve been working on.  
Thanks for visiting!
